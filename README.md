<h2 align="center"><img src="INSERT IMAGE"></h2>

This website is a little tool designed to enrich the experience when playing the boardgame [Indonesia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19777/indonesia). The site provides help with a process called "Merging", which involves a fair amount of math. By using the program players will be able to make faster, and more informed decisions.

This project in a slightly expanded rebuild of my very first JavaScript project.
