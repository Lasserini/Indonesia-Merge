## Bugs in need of fixing
-   If the user provides incorrect input, then the application requires a full restart in more cases than it should.
-   


## Other tasks
-   Move images to Github, rather than linking to external source.
-   Add "New Merge" button (and functionality).
-   Create CSS layout.
-   Allow user to change original input to get new results, without requireing a full reset.
